ABOUT:

SofiaBA - 3D Game for kids < 3 years old. Its intended to provide changes in
scenary and music, adding/removing special effects, as the child slams the keyboard.

On another level, its intended to provide bindings for the JMonkeyEngine. jME
is a cross-platform Gaming Engine, which provides an abundance of features. When
Im done extending the core functionality, I plan to provide wrappers to better
utilize the power of Lisp - Currently its a JavaInterop expedition :)

This is where Clojure comes in. Clojure is a Lisp-1 which sits on the JVM, its fully
dynamic, functional and geared for concurrency. Its being heavily developed upon by
its author Rich Hickey, and is therefor my language of choice.

If you're interested in Clojure, I suggest you stop by irc.freenode.net in channel
#clojure - There you'll find Rich, myself and others - I dare say, the Clojure community
is one of the best there is. And on that note, I'd like to give a special thanks
to Chris Houser (Chouser), who is a gifted programmer with the patience of a saint!
Without his help, sparring and input... I doubt I'd be working on 3D engines in Clojure
today.

---------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION:

You'll need to download JMonkeyEngine 2.0 from JMonkeyEngine.com,
You will also need LWJGL if you want to use the same rendering engine as me.

Start Java with it, in your library path, like:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH==/PATH/TO/sofiaba/src/deps/native/linux/
java -cp /path/to/clojure.jar:/path/to/sofiab/src/ clojure.lang.Repl

From the Repl, start the game like this

user> (set! *compile-path* "/path/to/sofiaba/classes/")
user> (compile 'dk.bestinclass.sofiaba)
user> (use :reload 'dk.bestinclass.sofiaba)
<runs initSystem and ouputs debugger-info>
user> (in-ns 'dk.bestinclass.dk)
#<Namespace dk.bestinclass.dk>
dk.bestinclass.dk> (-main)





I'll update this...tomorrow :)
