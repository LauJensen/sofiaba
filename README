SofiaBA - 3D Game for kids < 3 years old



You'll need to download JMonkeyEngine 2.0 from JMonkeyEngine.com,
You will also need LWJGL if you want to use the same rendering engine as me.

Start Java with it, in your library path, like:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH==/PATH/TO/sofiaba/src/deps/native/linux/


I'll update this...tomorrow :)
